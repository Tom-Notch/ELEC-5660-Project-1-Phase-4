# Environment Setup

We followed the instructions to set up the environment and have established a connection to the host via SSH to conduct experiments.

# Experiment

When experimenting, we reencountered hardware problems, which took us a long time to deal with. Due to operational errors, we replaced the flight controller multiple times during the experiments, ultimately ensuring the secure linkage and control between the remote controller and the drone.

In the experiments, OptiTrack System was used to track the motion and provide feedback on the state to control the drone. Ultimately, we completed the experiment, achieving the drone's autonomous flight along a predetermined trajectory. The related movements were captured by the motion capture system and displayed in Rviz.

In addition to the prescribed trajectory, we also designed an alternative route that allowed the aircraft to fly according to our constructed trajectory. The results are illustrated in the following figure.
